# Project2 - Hive Builder

## Overview

* Our first project was an event app where the user would be able to search for various events (concerts, shows, stand-up, etc) around a specified area. In Project 2, we wanted to take the event idea a little further. Instead of searching for events through APIs, we wanted to give users the ability to create/define their own events.
